### Optimal control of a mobile manipulator with 3D obstacle avoidance.

This is a C++ implementation of my course project for EN.530.603 - Applied Optimal Control, which was originally written in MATLAB.

Note: this project includes my own C++ implementation of a differential dynamic programming (DDP) code originally written
in MATLAB by Dr. Marin Kobilarov (marin(at)jhu.edu).

This code was developed purely to sharpen my own understanding of C++ and
differential dynamic programming, and is thus solely for educational purposes.
All credit for the DDP code goes to Dr. Kobilarov.
